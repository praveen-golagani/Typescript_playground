1. Promises are like a guarantee that something will happen in the future. 
   Imagine you order a pizza. The pizza shop promises to deliver it in 30 minutes. 
   While you wait, you can do other things. When the pizza arrives, you can enjoy it. 
   If something goes wrong, like the delivery gets delayed, you’ll be informed.


2. In programming, a Promise is a way to handle tasks that take time to complete, like fetching data from the internet. 
   It lets the program continue running while waiting for the task to finish, and then it deals with the result when it’s ready.
